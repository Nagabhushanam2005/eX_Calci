[Text]Abstract:
This project's goal is to develop an expense calculator utilizing the concepts of digital 
systems. It combines hardware and software elements to produce an integrated system
that can calculate expenses effectively. This project offers a chance to apply theoretical 
knowledge to a real-world situation in the field of digital systems, producing a useful 
and approachable expense calculator. This system puts forward a innovative solution to 
the user by keeping them conscious of the ongoing expenses through various mediums. 
Our motivation for this project was the need of

where money is being allocated, which is crucial for optimizing finances. 
As a team we would contribute to the way of life of every individual in management of 
finance, capital, investments and future conscious about oneâ€™s own expenditure. This 
small contribution by us can uplift the responsibility of the citizens and for a better 
future. Our expense calculator offers a comprehensive categorization system, allowing 
you to classify expenses with precision and even customize categories to suit your
